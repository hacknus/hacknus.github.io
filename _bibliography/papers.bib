    abstract = {We present our newly developed laboratory setup, called COCoNuT (Characteristic Observation of Cometary Nuclei using THz-spectroscopy), consisting of a THz spectro-goniometer in a vacuum chamber along with a cryo-cooler intended for cooling down samples rich in ices expected in cometary environments. This setup allows the use of THz time domain spectroscopy on analogs including refractory materials in the spectral range from 0.1 to 5.5 THz with a spectral resolution of up to 0.005 THz. Since the optical setup is mounted on a precision controlled x/y-stage, imaging or spatial averaging can be performed. In this work, we present the design decisions and selection of components. Furthermore, the commissioning of the setup is described and the capabilities are shown. The system can reach pressures of 10−7 mbar and temperatures of 50 K. For 2D scanning, a spatial resolution of 0.3 line-pair per mm is obtained.},

	title = {Evolution of granular salty ice analogs for {Europa}: {Sublimation} and {Irradiation}},
	abstract = {We study the evolution of the Vis-NIR reflectance spectrum of salty granular ice analog samples in a simulation chamber under conditions relevant to the surface of Europa. A novel application and custom calibration of a thermopile sensor enabled the measurement of the surface temperature of the samples in far infrared emission. This allows the kinetics of the observed changes to be scaled to equivalent timescales on Europa. We observed significant changes in the depth and shape of the broad water absorption bands for all samples on timescales of a few thousand years of equatorial conditions on Europa. A narrow absorption feature attributed to hydrohalite formed during the sublimation of the sodium chloride sample. We used Near-infrared spectroscopy in an irradiation chamber to assess the stability of this narrow feature under electron irradiation. We find that the radiation environment present on Europa dehydrates the hydrohalite on short timescales, and therefore, we expect hydrohalite not to be present on the surface.},

	abstract = {Cryogenic experiments strongly depend on accurate temperature measurements. Many of the sensors used for these purposes are glued to the object to be measured to achieve adequate thermal contact. This calls for a more ﬂexible, long lasting and robust bolt-mounted solution. Therefore, we present a low-cost ({\textless}5\$), compact, PCB (printed circuit board) based sensor mount for RTDs (resistance temperature detector) and diodes showing reliable results at temperatures from 50 K to 400 K with possible modiﬁcations for an extended range down below 20 K. We anticipate that the robustness and low cost of the reported sensor mount design will strongly enhance the accessibility of reliable temperature measurements at a wide range of temperatures in laboratory applications.},

	abstract = {Here we describe the novel, multi-point Comet Interceptor mission. It is dedicated to the exploration of a little-processed long-period comet, possibly entering the inner Solar System for the ﬁrst time, or to encounter an interstellar object originating at another star. The objectives of the mission are to address the following questions: What are the surface composition, shape, morphology, and structure of the target object? What is the composition of the gas and dust in the coma, its connection to the nucleus, and the nature of its interaction with the solar wind? The mission was proposed to the European Space Agency in 2018, and formally adopted by the agency in June 2022, for launch in 2029 together with the Ariel mission. Comet Interceptor will take advantage of the opportunity presented by ESA’s FClass call for fast, ﬂexible, low-cost missions to which it was proposed. The call required a launch to a halo orbit around the Sun-Earth L2 point. The mission can take advantage of this placement to wait for the discovery of a suitable comet reachable with its minimum ΔV capability of 600 ms−1. Comet Interceptor will be unique in encountering and studying, at a nominal closest approach distance of 1000 km, a comet that represents a near-pristine sample of material from the formation of the Solar System. It will also add a capability that no previous cometary mission has had, which is to deploy two sub-probes – B1, provided by the Japanese space agency, JAXA, and B2 – that will follow different trajectories through the coma. While the main probe passes at a nominal 1000 km distance, probes B1 and B2 will follow different chords through the coma at distances of 850 km and 400 km, respectively. The result will be unique, simultaneous, spatially resolved information of the 3-dimensional properties of the target comet and its interaction with the space environment. We present the mission’s science background leading to these objectives, as well as an overview of the scientiﬁc instruments, mission design, and schedule.},
