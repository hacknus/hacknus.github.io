	title = {Low-cost temperature sensor mount for cryogenic thermometry},
	abstract = {Cryogenic experiments depend strongly on accurate temperature measurements. Currently, most of the sensors used for these purposes are glued to have an adequate thermal contact to the object that is measured. In order to have a more flexible and robust solution, we show a compact sensor mount for RTDs and diodes at temperatures from 70 K to 400 K with possible modifications for an extended range down below 20 K.},
