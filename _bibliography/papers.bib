  abstract = {Understanding how planets formed from the protoplanetary disk requires access to primordial material that has remained largely unaltered since the earliest stages of Solar System evolution. Comets, preserved in distant reservoirs such as the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud and exposed to significant solar heating only during brief perihelion passages, are among the most pristine remnants of planetesimal formation. Their internal structure and composition therefore provide key constraints for testing competing models of planetary growth, including classical hierarchical accretion and pebble-based formation scenarios. Previous spacecraft missions have relied primarily on infrared spectroscopy for surface characterization and ground-penetrating radar for probing the interior. While radar instruments like CONSERT have demonstrated the ability to explore subsurface layers, their spatial resolution is intrinsically limited by meter-scale wavelengths. Conversely, infrared techniques offer fine spatial detail but lack the ability to penetrate below the surface. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) occupies an intermediate regime, capable of providing centimeter-scale penetration while achieving millimeter-scale spatial resolution, and additionally offers spectroscopic sensitivity to key molecular species, such as amino acids, through characteristic absorption features in the THz band. This thesis investigates the feasibility of THz-TDS as a novel method for in-situ subsurface analysis of cometary nuclei. To this end, we developed COCoNuT (Characteristic Observation of Cometary Nuclei using THz-spectroscopy), a laboratory facility that integrates a commercial THz time-domain spectrometer within a thermal-vacuum environment to simulate cometary surface and subsurface conditions. Using a suite of cometary analog materials, we perform proof-of-concept experiments to evaluate penetration depth, spatial resolution, data interpretation techniques, and the detectability of embedded structures and molecular signatures. The outcomes of this work establish the potential of THz-TDS as a complementary tool for future missions aimed at characterizing the internal structure and composition of small bodies in the Solar System.},

    abstract = {We study the evolution of the Vis-NIR reflectance spectrum of salty granular ice analog samples in a simulation chamber under conditions relevant to the surface of Europa. A novel application and custom calibration of a thermopile sensor enabled the measurement of the surface temperature of the samples in far infrared emission. This allows the kinetics of the observed changes to be scaled to equivalent timescales on Europa. We observed significant changes in the depth and shape of the broad water absorption bands for all samples on timescales of a few thousand years of equatorial conditions on Europa. This effect should be taken into account if quantitative predictions about bulk composition are made based on remote-sensing data. A narrow absorption feature attributed to hydrohalite formed during the sublimation of the sodium chloride sample. We used near-infrared spectroscopy in an irradiation chamber to assess the stability of this narrow feature under electron irradiation. We find that the radiation environment present on Europa dehydrates the hydrohalite on short timescales. Therefore, we expect hydrohalite not to be present on the surface, unless erupted very recently (<10 yr) or located in thermal anomalies (> 145 K), so a detection of hydrohalite clearly indicates recent activity.}

  abstract={Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is a powerful tool for nondestructive testing, but the quality of scans is limited by beam spreading effects, which vary with frequency. We propose a deconvolution method that accounts for the changing beam width as a function of frequency. By incorporating frequency-specific Gaussian beam profiles, determined through the knife-edge technique, the proposed method enhances the spatial resolution of THz-TDS scans while keeping the ability to analyze the phase of the signals. Our approach significantly improves contrast and sharpness in both reflectance and transmission modes. This technique offers a more accurate and robust enhancement of THz-TDS imaging.},

This setup allows the use of THz time domain spectroscopy on analogs including refractory materials in the spectral range from 0.1 to 5.5 THz with a spectral resolution of up to 0.005 THz. Since the optical setup is mounted on a precision controlled x/y-stage, imaging or spatial averaging can be performed. In this work, we present the design decisions and selection of components. Furthermore, the commissioning of the setup is described and the capabilities are shown. The system can reach pressures of 10−7 mbar and temperatures of 50 K. For 2D scanning, a spatial resolution of 0.3 line-pair per mm is obtained.},

	abstract = {Here we describe the novel, multi-point Comet Interceptor mission. It is dedicated to the exploration of a little-processed long-period comet, possibly entering the inner Solar System for the ﬁrst time, or to encounter an interstellar object originating at another star. The objectives of the mission are to address the following questions: What are the surface composition, shape, morphology, and structure of the target object? What is the composition of the gas and dust in the coma, its connection to the nucleus, and the nature of its interaction with the solar wind? The mission was proposed to the European Space Agency in 2018, and formally adopted by the agency in June 2022, for launch in 2029 together with the Ariel mission. Comet Interceptor will take advantage of the opportunity presented by ESA’s FClass call for fast, ﬂexible, low-cost missions to which it was proposed. The call required a launch to a halo orbit around the Sun-Earth L2 point. The mission can take advantage of this placement to wait for the discovery of a suitable comet reachable with its minimum ΔV capability of 600 ms−1. Comet Interceptor will be unique in encountering and studying, at a nominal closest approach distance of 1000 km, a comet that represents a near-pristine sample of material from the formation of the Solar System. It will also add a capability that no previous cometary mission has had, which is to deploy two sub-probes – B1, provided by the Japanese space agency, JAXA, and B2 – that will follow different trajectories through the coma. While the main probe passes at a nominal 1000 km distance, probes B1 and B2 will follow different chords through the coma at distances of 850 km and 400 km, respectively. The result will be unique, simultaneous, spatially resolved information of the 3-dimensional properties of the target comet and its interaction with the space environment. We present the mission’s science background leading to these objectives, as well as an overview of the scientiﬁc instruments, mission design, and schedule.},

    abstract = {Particle–particle and particle–gas processes significantly impact planetary precursors such as dust aggregates and planetesimals. We investigate gas permeability (\$\\kappa\$) in 12 granular samples, mimicking planetesimal dust regoliths. Using parabolic flights, this study assesses how gravitational compression – and lack thereof – influences gas permeation, impacting the equilibrium state of low-gravity objects. Transitioning between micro- and hyper-gravity induces granular sedimentation dynamics, revealing collective dust–grain aerodynamics. Our experiments measure \$\\kappa\$ across Knudsen number (Kn) ranges, reflecting transitional flow. Using mass and momentum conservation, we derive \$\\kappa\$ and calculate pressure gradients within the granular matrix. Key findings: (i) As confinement pressure increases with gravitational load and mass flow, \$\\kappa\$ and average pore space decrease. This implies that a planetesimal’s unique dust-compaction history limits subsurface volatile outflows. (ii) The derived pressure gradient enables tensile strength determination for asteroid regolith simulants with cohesion. This offers a unique approach to studying dust-layer properties when suspended in confinement pressures comparable to the equilibrium state on planetesimals surfaces, which will be valuable for modelling their collisional evolution. (iii) We observe a dynamical flow symmetry breaking when granular material moves against the pressure gradient. This occurs even at low Reynolds numbers, suggesting that Stokes numbers for drifting dust aggregates near the Stokes–Epstein transition require a drag force modification based on permeability.},
