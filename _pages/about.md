Researcher, based in Bern.
I completed my Bachelor studies in Physics at the University of Zurich (UZH), my Master studies in Applied Astrophysics at the University of Bern (UniBe)
and my PhD also at UniBe with the focus on THz spectroscopy for cometary exploration.
I'm currently a researcher at UniBe focusing on cometary and planetary research and instrumentation.

I enjoy working on hardware and software side projects, most of them include the design, assembly and programming of electronics.
I have published several software packages on **github**, **crates.io** and **pypi**.
