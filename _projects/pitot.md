The pitot tube prototype is designed as an all-in-one plug-and-play system to gather data.  
It was developed as part of the [ARIS EULER](https://aris-space.ch/project-euler/) project in 2020.
The design files are uploaded in this [repository](https://github.com/aris-space/aris-pitot-tube).

The pitot tube gathered data on a supersonic and a subsonic flight at EUROC in Portugal.
